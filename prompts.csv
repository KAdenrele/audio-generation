"The code was adapted to my need for data on oral antihistamines used for the management of hayfever only."
"It is important to note that a change in NHS organisational structure resulted in a change from Area Teams to STPs (Sustainablity Transformation Partnerships)."
"The column containing geographical data which remains consistent through time is the post code column."
"After extraction, an ONS dataset containing postcode, area classification and area name was merged to the dataset."
"The time taken to extract data using this method is recorded below."
"In part one, 25minutes were required to extract two datasets."
"Here, less than 30seconds are required."
"This is more than 50 times faster."
"There also appears to be some relationship between the highest pollen count across the types of pollen each day and the quantity of oral antihistamines supplied."
"This relationship and distrubution must be confirmed and/or quantified."
"To check if the 2019 data is normally distributed, the data will be passed into a probability plot and shapiro-wilk test will be used to investigate."
"This test returned a p value of 0.27 which is far above the significance level of 0.05."
"The null hypothesis, that the data is normally distributed, can not be rejected."
"This information will inform further tests such as those for statistically significant difference(s)."
"Global and rolling Pearson’s r are the chosen method for measuring correlation between pollen count and the quantites of oral antihistmaines prescribed."
"This method is limited by the assumption that the relationship is linear."
"It is also susceptible to the influence of outliers."
"In addititon, pollen count data is only collected by the MET office from March to August each year."
"Pearson’s r can only be calculated using lists of equal length."
"In this example, missing values were not filled with zero or values from any average, the calculation is limited to those months only."
"Global Correlation An r value of 0.22 (globally) indicates a very weak correlation which is not statistically significant given the p-value."
"However, rolling values provide a different picture with r nearing 1 at some points."
"This test is a very simple one; more sophisticated methods are available and will need to be explored."
"For all antihistamines, the total is £13,170,473.0."
"There was a 21% increase in the cost of antihistamine prescribing from 2019 (£24,246,297.41) to 2020 (£29,235,249.51)."
"We are currently at pace for a similar spending increase, however, that would require confirmation with a model which will be built in another part of this series."

"ONS Area Classification Using postcode as the key, data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) was joined to the EPD dataframe."
"This allowed for exploration of prescribing by ONS area classifications."
"The mean cost of oral antihistamine prescribing per area is shown below."
"As this data is normally distributed but possesses an unequal population size, Welch’s t test is an example of a test which can be used to test for significant differences."
"The top two area classes are tested below."
"The p value exceeds the chosen significance level of 0.05."
"As such, the null hypothesis can not be rejected; there is no statistically significant difference between the means."

"As such, the null hypothesis can not be rejected; there is no statistically significant difference between the means."
"Limitations Include but not… limited to: Antihistamines are used for multiple indications."
"This analysis does not consider whether Fexofenadine, for example, was prescribed for hayfever or for urticaria in each instance."
"The number of patients prescribed each item is not included in the dataset."
"Data related to items per patient in GP surgerys’ records is available on the OpenPrescribing platform."
"This dataset does not include medication prescribed in hospitals or other settings outside primary care."
"Distribute Tasks Using Free AWS EC2 Cloud Computing Services At this point, most of my time has been spent extracting data before any analysis or visualisation could be completed."
"Model selection, if I want to save time, will require a more powerful machine than my 2017 MacbookAir."
"Buying another machine is not an option, however, I am able to write very simple distributed programs using XML-RPC as a result of teaching on the Data Science course at the University of Surrey."
"The steps for doing so are described below."
"Launching the Instance Within the EC2 dashboard, launch an instance."
"I choose the free tier options despite having free credits as a student."
"The extra computational power may come in handy one day."
"Ensure the key-pair (.pem file) is downloaded (if you do not have one already)."
"I also store this in the same location/file path as all documents related to this project."
"It will make the process much easier."
"Connect to the Instance Within the Terminal (Mac), navigate to the location housing all files related to the project, including the .pem file."
"The ls and cd commands are most helpful for viewing files within a directory and changing directory respetively."
"The tab key for autocompletion of directory/file names helps to avoid errors."
"Within the directory, enter:"
"For a project which requires a year’s worth of data for dev and train samples, this is clearly inefficient."
"Here, the aim will be increased time efficiency, to explore the data and to connect to a remote server in preparation for computationally expensive tasks."

"Extracting Data from the CKAN API using SQL As shared by Adam Ivison in the Github repository here, the data can be extracted using SQL."
"The code was adapted to my need for data on oral antihistamines used for the management of hayfever only."
"It is important to note that a change in NHS organisational structure resulted in a change from Area Teams to STPs (Sustainablity Transformation Partnerships)."
"The column containing geographical data which remains consistent through time is the post code column."
"After extraction, an ONS dataset containing postcode, area classification and area name was merged to the dataset."
"The time taken to extract data using this method is recorded below."
"In part one, 25minutes were required to extract two datasets."
"Here, less than 30seconds are required."
"This is more than 50 times faster."
"There also appears to be some relationship between the highest pollen count across the types of pollen each day and the quantity of oral antihistamines supplied."
"This relationship and distrubution must be confirmed and/or quantified."
"To check if the 2019 data is normally distributed, the data will be passed into a probability plot and shapiro-wilk test will be used to investigate."
"This test returned a p value of 0.27 which is far above the significance level of 0.05."
"The null hypothesis, that the data is normally distributed, can not be rejected."
"This information will inform further tests such as those for statistically significant difference(s)."
"Global and rolling Pearson’s r are the chosen method for measuring correlation between pollen count and the quantites of oral antihistmaines prescribed."
"This method is limited by the assumption that the relationship is linear."
"It is also susceptible to the influence of outliers."
"In addititon, pollen count data is only collected by the MET office from March to August each year."
"Pearson’s r can only be calculated using lists of equal length."
"In this example, missing values were not filled with zero or values from any average, the calculation is limited to those months only."
"Global Correlation An r value of 0.22 (globally) indicates a very weak correlation which is not statistically significant given the p-value."
"However, rolling values provide a different picture with r nearing 1 at some points."
"This test is a very simple one; more sophisticated methods are available and will need to be explored."
"For all antihistamines, the total is £13,170,473.0."
"There was a 21% increase in the cost of antihistamine prescribing from 2019 (£24,246,297.41) to 2020 (£29,235,249.51)."
"We are currently at pace for a similar spending increase, however, that would require confirmation with a model which will be built in another part of this series."
"This change should result in savings for the health service, however, this is not happening… yet."
"It is important to note that the 120mg product is not yet available in the UK as of the first of July 2021."
"ONS Area Classification Using postcode as the key, data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) was joined to the EPD dataframe."
"This allowed for exploration of prescribing by ONS area classifications."
"The mean cost of oral antihistamine prescribing per area is shown below."
"As this data is normally distributed but possesses an unequal population size, Welch’s t test is an example of a test which can be used to test for significant differences."
